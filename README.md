# Project Name AirBnB_clone
This is a simplified version of the Airbnb platform implemented as part of a learning project. It includes a command-line interface (CLI) for managing various aspects of property rental management.
## Description
The AirBnB Clone project aims to replicate some of the basic functionalities of the Airbnb platform, allowing users to manage properties, bookings, and reviews through a command-line interface. The project is structured into multiple modules, including models for representing different entities like states, cities, amenities, places, and reviews, as well as a file storage engine for data persistence.
